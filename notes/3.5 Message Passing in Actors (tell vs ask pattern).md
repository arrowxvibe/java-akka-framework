## 3.5.1 Introduction
Message passing is the fundamental communication mechanism in Akkaâ€™s actor model. Akka actors interact by exchanging immutable messages, ensuring safe concurrency.

This section covers the two primary patterns of message passing:
1. **Tell Pattern (`tell()`)** - Fire-and-forget, no response expected.
2. **Ask Pattern (`ask()`)** - Asynchronous request-response communication.

---

## 3.5.2 The Tell Pattern (`tell()`)
The `tell()` method is the preferred way for actors to send messages without expecting a reply. It is a non-blocking, asynchronous method that enables high scalability.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Fire-and-forget:** The sender does not wait for a response.
- **Fast and efficient:** Since no response is expected, it minimizes performance overhead.
- **One-way communication:** Used when an acknowledgment is not required.

### Example: Sending a Message with `tell()`
```java
import akka.actor.*;

// Define an Actor
class PrintActor extends AbstractActor {
    @Override
    public Receive createReceive() {
        return receiveBuilder()
            .match(String.class, message -> {
                System.out.println("Received: " + message);
            })
            .build();
    }
}

// Main class
public class TellExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("TellSystem");
        ActorRef actorRef = system.actorOf(Props.create(PrintActor.class), "printActor");
        
        // Send message using tell
        actorRef.tell("Hello, Akka!", ActorRef.noSender());
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- The `PrintActor` prints the received message.
- `tell()` sends the message without waiting for a response.
- `ActorRef.noSender()` indicates that no acknowledgment is needed.

## 3.5.3 The Ask Pattern (`ask()`)
The `ask()` method is used when a response is required from the receiving actor. Since actors process messages asynchronously, `ask()` returns a `CompletionStage<T>` (Javaâ€™s Future equivalent).

### Key Characteristics:
- **Asynchronous request-response:** The sender expects a reply.
- **Requires a timeout:** As messages are processed asynchronously, a timeout must be specified.
- **Creates a temporary actor:** Akka internally spawns a hidden actor to receive the response.

### Example: Request-Response with `ask()`
```java
import akka.actor.*;
import akka.pattern.AskPattern;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage;

// Define an Actor
class QueryActor extends AbstractActor {
    @Override
    public Receive createReceive() {
        return receiveBuilder()
            .matchEquals("query", msg -> {
                getSender().tell("Response from QueryActor", getSelf());
            })
            .build();
    }
}

// Main class
public class AskExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("AskSystem");
        ActorRef actorRef = system.actorOf(Props.create(QueryActor.class), "queryActor");

        Duration timeout = Duration.ofSeconds(3);
        CompletionStage<Object> response = AskPattern.ask(
            actorRef,
            replyTo -> "query",
            timeout,
            system.scheduler()
        );

        response.thenAccept(reply -> {
            System.out.println("Received reply: " + reply);
        });
    }
}
```
### Explanation
- The `QueryActor` responds when it receives a "query" message.
- `AskPattern.ask()` sends a request and returns a `CompletionStage<Object>`.
- The response is handled asynchronously with `thenAccept()`.

## 3.5.4 Comparing `tell()` vs `ask()`

| Feature         | `tell()` | `ask()` |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Expect Response | No      | Yes     |
| Performance    | High    | Lower (due to awaiting response) |
| Use Case      | Fire-and-forget messages | Request-response communication |

---

## 3.5.5 Best Practices
- Use **`tell()`** for high-performance, one-way message passing.
- Use **`ask()`** sparingly, as it introduces additional overhead.
- Prefer **event-driven architectures** where actors notify others of changes instead of polling for responses.
- Always **set a timeout** when using `ask()` to avoid indefinite waits.

---

## 3.5.6 Summary
- **Actors communicate via immutable messages to ensure thread safety.**
- **`tell()` is the preferred method for fire-and-forget messaging.**
- **`ask()` is useful when a response is required but adds performance overhead.**
- **Properly designing actor interactions can improve system scalability and responsiveness.**
