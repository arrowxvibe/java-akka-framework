## [1.1 What is Akka?](1.1%20What%20is%20Akka?.md)

Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM. It simplifies managing concurrency, scalability, and resilience using the **Actor Model**.

### Key Features of Akka:

- **Actor-based Concurrency**: Encapsulates state and behavior within actors that communicate via messages.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implements the "Let it crash" philosophy with supervision strategies.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales across multiple cores and nodes.
- **Location Transparency**: Allows remote communication without changing the actor model.
- **Reactive Principles**: Designed for responsiveness, elasticity, resilience, and message-driven communication.

## [1.2 Why Use Akka?](1.2%20Why%20use%20Akka?.md)

Akka is used to build applications that require high **concurrency, scalability, and fault tolerance**. Hereâ€™s why developers choose Akka:

### Benefits:

- **Non-Blocking & Asynchronous**: Avoids thread blocking, making applications more efficient.
- **Handles Millions of Actors**: Lightweight actors enable efficient concurrent processing.
- **Resilient to Failures**: Uses actor supervision for self-healing applications.
- **Distributed & Clustered Computing**: Supports remote communication and clustering.
- **Integrates with Streaming & Persistence**: Works seamlessly with Akka Streams and Akka Persistence.

### Threads vs Akka Actors

| Feature               | Traditional Threads                   | Akka Actors                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **State Management**  | Shared memory, synchronization needed | Encapsulated state, no synchronization needed |
| **Concurrency Model** | OS threads and locks                  | Message-driven actors                         |
| **Failure Handling**  | Requires try-catch, error propagation | Supervision strategies, self-healing          |
| **Scalability**       | Limited by thread count               | Can handle millions of actors                 |
| **Performance**       | Context switching overhead            | Lightweight, event-driven                     |

### [Executors](Executors.md)

Executors in Java (such as `ThreadPoolExecutor`) provide better thread management, but they still require manual tuning and synchronization.

- **FixedThreadPool**: A fixed number of threads that process tasks in a queue.
- **CachedThreadPool**: Dynamic thread creation for handling varying workloads.
- **WorkStealingPool**: Allows idle threads to "steal" tasks from busy threads.

**Limitations of Executors**:

- **Still requires synchronization** for shared resources.
- **No built-in fault tolerance** like Akkaâ€™s supervision strategy.
- **Not designed for distributed computing**.



Other concurrency models include:

- **Futures & Promises**: Handles async tasks but lacks failure supervision.
- **Reactive Streams**: Manages backpressure but requires extra libraries.
- **Functional Concurrency**: Uses immutable data structures, but managing async logic can be complex.

## [1.4 Akkaâ€™s Actor Model Overview](1.4%20Akka%E2%80%99s%20Actor%20Model%20Overview.md)

The **Actor Model** in Akka is based on the idea of small, independent entities (**actors**) that communicate only via asynchronous messages.

### Actor Characteristics:

1. **Encapsulation**: Actors manage their own state.
2. **Message-driven**: Actors communicate via immutable messages.
3. **Lightweight**: Can create millions of actors efficiently.
4. **Supervision & Fault Tolerance**: Parent actors manage child actors.

### Basic Actor Lifecycle:

1. **Create** - Actor instance is created.
2. **Receive Messages** - Processes incoming messages.
3. **Change Behavior** - Can change behavior dynamically.
4. **Restart / Resume** - Can recover from failures.
5. **Stop** - Actor is terminated.

## [1.5 Akka Ecosystem Overview](1.5%20Akka%20Ecosystem%20Overview.md)

Akka provides a rich set of tools for different use cases:

### Core Modules:

- **Akka Actors**: The foundation of the Akka framework.
